# Calculator.js
This calculator was made as an example project after following The Odin Project. It's a pretty swanky course.

At this point [4.1.25], the program is in an MVP stage.

# Install instructions
Download the html, js, and css files. In terminal, run `python -m http.server` to host a simple webserver on your local network to try it out. 

# TODOS
## For when I have time to burn
- Add some schnazzy CSS
- Reorganize the codebase and purge unused code
- Add keyboard support
