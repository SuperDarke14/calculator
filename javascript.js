//First, dynamically generate DOM

//set a function or variable to modify calc window
//function to take input from button to push it to window


//Then implement math functionality within calculator window
//add fnct
//subtract fnc
//multiply func
//divite func
//operate fnc- take operator and 2 vars and call above func
 

//implement nice-to-haves in dom 
//like clearScreen();


//SPECS
//must ONLY work on TWO (2) numbers and ONE (1) operator
//Round answers 
//Error handling if operate() is called [equal sign pressed] before input complete
//eraseAll() to kill all data in input
//backspace() to backspace 
//needs funky divideBy0 message
//Apparently double-pressing the operator is bad
//Add decimal input
//After results are displayed, need to start new calculation
